# Border Radius Previewer

This project is based on [App Ideas Collection](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repo. Border radius previewer: the border-radius property can have multiple values changed. Preview how the shape looks while changing these values.

## Requirements

- [x] User can see a box which has a `border-radius` property applied to it.
- [x] User can change the 4 `border-radius` values that are applied to the box.
- [x] User can copy the resulting CSS to the clipboard.

## Bonus

- [] User can change all 8 possible values of the border-radius in order to create a complex shape.
- [x] Unit tests to test html and js files. It's inspired by this [article](https://dev.to/thawkin3/how-to-unit-test-html-and-vanilla-javascript-without-a-ui-framework-4io).
